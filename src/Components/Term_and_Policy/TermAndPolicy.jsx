            On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and

            pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot
            foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal
            blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of
            will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and
            pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish.
            <br /> In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and
            when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every
            pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain
            circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of
            business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be
            repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always
            holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects
            pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures
            pains to avoid worse paincs.
